We are a group of residents from Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst who LOVE QUEENS and want to see it stay the vibrant place that it is. We know it’s not perfect, but we also know that the Citi Field Casino proposal (AKA Queens Future land use permit AKA Metropolitan Park) would be devastating for our borough. 

We are committed to educating the community about where this project is, why it is detrimental to our way of life, and how to have your voice heard. 


### Who are you? 

You are opposed to the Citi field casino. You live in Queens. All neighborhoods welcome! And all welcome if you aren’t from Queens. 

Why are you opposed?

Maybe you were one of the many denied a speaking spot at the CB3 meeting like this Redditor, passed over for someone already promised a community benefit from the Metropolitan Park outreach team.
Maybe you have a personal experience with a loved one with a gambling addiction and are worried about what a casino in the neighborhood will mean.
Maybe you are concerned about an increase in organized crime and human trafficking which often happen at casino/hotel/convention center complexes
Maybe you hate just hate casinos.
Maybe you were annoyed by the dozens of paid canvassers from Metropolitan Park plan that called you for months, and then just asked you if you wanted a new Park in the neighborhood before hanging up. They didn’t tell you about the casino, did they?  
Maybe you hate the undemocratic influence of unelected billionaires. 
Maybe you love your neighborhood and realize this plan will make it more difficult to stay due to development pressures. 


Whatever your reason, we welcome your support and energy. Every action helps, and your voice is louder with this hyper-local issue!
